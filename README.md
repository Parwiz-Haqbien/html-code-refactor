### html-code-refactor is where I code for Horiseon Marketing Agency to allow a greater user accessibility. I did this by updating the html and css to meet the current accessibility standards, targeting most of the alt attributes and logical structure. I have made the heading sizes to different sizes for a cleaner and better useability.
